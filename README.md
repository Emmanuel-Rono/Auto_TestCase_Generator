# Automated Test Case Generation with Neo4j AuraDB and Gemini AI

This project presents an innovative approach to automating test case generation by integrating Neo4j AuraDB, a fully managed cloud graph database service, with Google's Gemini AI model. The system is designed to enhance the efficiency, scalability, and intelligence of software testing processes.

## Key Features

### Neo4j AuraDB Knowledge Graph

- **Structured Data Representation**: Utilizes Neo4j AuraDB to model software requirements and their associated test cases as nodes and relationships within a knowledge graph. This structure enables a clear and organized representation of complex data interconnections.

- **Efficient Querying and Management**: The graph-based structure allows for rapid querying and retrieval of information. For instance, identifying all test cases linked to a specific requirement becomes straightforward, facilitating efficient impact analysis and traceability.

- **Scalability**: Neo4j AuraDB's cloud infrastructure ensures that the knowledge graph can scale seamlessly with the growing volume of requirements and test cases, maintaining performance and reliability.

### Gemini AI Integration

- **Automated Test Case Generation**: Employs the Gemini AI model to analyze existing requirements and test cases. By recognizing patterns and leveraging predefined test case templates, it dynamically generates new test cases.

- **Template Utilization**: To ensure consistency, the AI model structures the generated test cases according to predefined templates, aligning them with industry standards and best practices.
